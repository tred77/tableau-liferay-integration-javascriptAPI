# Tableau Integration Into Liferay with JavaScript API

Initial Idea comes from this [code](https://github.com/davidproba/tableau-integration-poc) from David Proba.
Here, we load Tableau report with the aim of Tableau JavaScript API which help us to have control over the loaded report, from Liferay portlet and have the chance of governance those controls with Liferay preference and permissions.
